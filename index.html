    <p>I am Joyeta Mondal Kotha. I am from bangladesh, I belong to a family which loves and supports music a lot, specially classical music. I have been learning music sincs, I don't know, maybe when I was 2 or 3 years old. My mother used to sing, she;s alwaays been my biggest teacher, mentor and supporter in music. My father is also very supportive towards music. My moto with music is to make people know more about classical music, its dimension, its variety and hence making people listen more to classsical music. Thank you for visiting my site. If you like my content, please stay tuned with me and don't forget to share your thoughts about music, also tell me which genre do you like most. Spread love through music, for music!!!!
